do NOT fall for this crappy super slow tablet.. I tried hard , very hard for two weeks to CONVINCE myself that I'm too picky , that I'm asking too much ... I tried to justify its flaws .. In vein .. I ended up hating that piece of disaster so much, to the point I HAD TO THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE CAN.. instead of returning it.. I thought to give it as a present to a child but soon I realized that no child deserves to get so frustrated by its slugginess and hardware ugliness
