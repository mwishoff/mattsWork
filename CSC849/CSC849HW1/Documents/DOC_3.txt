It worked great for the first few months. Then started having issues with the touch screen. Then the charging port went bad and I had to send it to ASUS for repair. The charging problem was fixed but the touch screen issues were not. It seems to be temperature sensitive-in cooler environments it functions properly but when it's warmer the touch screen won't work at all. Also, the charging port that got replaced is going bad again. This tablet would get five stars if it actually worked properly.
