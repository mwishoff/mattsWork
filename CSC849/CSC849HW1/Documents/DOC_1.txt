This one was one of the most powerful systems on 2013, and still has some things like Slimport that do a plus when is compared to more modern but lower profile options from now-days.

The screen is awesome, the only counter-back is that ridiculously even if is know has the Asus Nexus "from Google", Google does the worst use of their own OS, when we compared with the ones on LG or Sony systems.

So the Hardware from Asus = 5 Stars, flawless a topnotch gear at great price, this still rocks even on 2015 and next year too.
Software, OS from Google= 1 Star, awful even if is updated.
