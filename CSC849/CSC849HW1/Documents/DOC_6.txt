Upgraded from a Nexus 7 older model. You can easily notice the difference: The screen is great, the stero speakers and the rear camera additions are really appreciated and overall it feels fast and responsive, unlike my older Nexus 7 (specially after upgrading to Android L). I guess the only thing I'm not thrilled about is the responsiveness of the screen, I have the feeling that my older tablet reacted to a lighter touch compared to this one. Overall I'm quite happy with my purchase.
