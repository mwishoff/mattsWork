I really love my Nexus! My husband surprised me for my birthday a year ago with this. I'd only used an iPhone before so I wasn't sure about getting used to an android operating system but now I prefer it. I love having a back button! I love being able to move the cursor where I want it. I like the size of this, not too big or small. I read a lot of ebooks and its weight is good. I immediately put a tech armor screen protector and devicewear case on it to protect it. Sometimes my camera won't work but if I restart the device than it works again fine. I have an iPhone and iPod touch but I much prefer this to an iPad. The price was great for all the storage and a tablet that is fast and works well.
