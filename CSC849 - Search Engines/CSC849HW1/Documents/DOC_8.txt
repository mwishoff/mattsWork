Bricked by an update pushed over the air. This was 100% stock. I loved it for the first year, then this happened 2 months out of warranty. Asus wanted $200 to fix it (more than a new one). Google the problem and you will see it is a widespread issue experienced by hundreds. Asus won't acknowledge the issue. I ended up sending it in just to get the repair estimate and submitted that to American Express which automatically added a year to the warranty when I bought it. I then used the claim money to buy parts on eBay and got it working again. One month later it failed for another common issue. The touch screen became jumpy and unresponsive. Piece of junk I've wasted too much time on. A shame because I really liked it at first. My dealings with ASUS resulted in a complete loss of confidence with the company. Although some of their products have good reviews (even this one, amazingly), I now avoid ASUS products completely because I'm not willing to roll the dice with them again. If ASUS had acknowledged the problem, fixed defective units, and released a revision, it would have cost them a trivial amount of money. It would have been the right thing to do. Instead, they are writing off customers as a less expensive loss.
