I've been using net books for a few years now, finally bought s tablet. I've had it for over 6mos now and now problems whatsoever. I use it for watching movies, games (emulators), shopping, browsing the web, and I just started editing my gopro videos on it with Kinemaster

I am very surprised at the ease of editing 720p videos from my hero4. I know it's not as good as my big PC or a dedicated video editing machine, but the convenience of this little tablet is what counts. I'm just happy to get my videos off my hero4 and onto Vimeo.
